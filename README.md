# imagepredict_mnist

"MnistAPP.py" is the main application of this project based on python3.6.
MnistAPP.py uses a mnist model (trained for 20000 times) named "model2".
*Uploading images is required when using this app and uploaded images will be stored in a folder named "uploaded_images" which should be in the same directory as MnistAPP.py.
*"uploaded_images" folder is not in this branch as you see; erros will be reported without this folder.
The latest cassandra docker container is required.
